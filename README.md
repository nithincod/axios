Foodify: Food Image Classification and Calorie Intake Estimator App

Project Overview
Foodify is a Flutter mobile app designed to assist users in the identification of food items and in calculating their calorie intake by utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for food classification. Additionally, the app offers a wonderful user experience, allowing users to search for food items and instantly receive calorie information by identifying food images through an API request.

Features
Food Classification: It classifies food items with the help of a CNN model based on images.

Calorie Calculation: Calculating calories by identifying food images with API requests.

Search Functionality: The user shall be able to search for food items in the list of food items defined in advance.

Food Details: The feature details each food item with its name and calorie content.

User Authentication: It provides a safe user login and logout feature.

Interactive UI: The user interface is engaging, featuring responsive design and snack bar interactions.

Technical Stack
Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
Backend: Firebase for authentication
Machine Learning Model: Convolutional Neural Network for the food classification
API Integration: RESTful API for Calorie Calculation
State Management: Stateful Widgets, setState for handling state

How It's Made
1. Flutter Framework:
The user interface of the application is built with Flutter to provide a seamless and engaging user experience. Stateful widgets are used in handling the state of the application.
2. Machine Learning Model:
This component includes a CNN model in the application that classifies image-based food items. The training for this model is based on a dataset of images of food items, which are identified as various foods as accurately as possible.
3. API for Calorie Calculation:
This will integrate an API that ingests an image of food and sends back the number of calories for the identified food item. The API will invoke this function whenever a user is about to either upload or capture a food image.

4. Firebase Authentication
Firebase is handled for user authentication, including login and logout functionality.
